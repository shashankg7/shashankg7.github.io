I am incredibly happy to finally have a personal website and blog up and running. I've been wanting to do this for a long time. But things - primarily procrastination - often get in the way.  


It's bare-bones, but I love how it looks. It's also completely static, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). As a huge fan of minimalist design, [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/) was a perfect theme to quick-start with. Future themes will be my own designs. Hopefully.


I discovered Jekyll while crawling the interwebz, trying to decide which framework to use for a blog. It took a couple of days to get used to, but it's probably much easier than experimenting with back-end frameworks and definitely more lightweight than a full-fledged CMS. Not to forget, it generates static pages and hence, lightning fast loading time!


Apart from Jekyll, I used

*	[Disqus](http://disqus.com/) for comments
*	[Font Awesome](fontawesome.io) for social media icons
*	[Simple Form](https://getsimpleform.com/) for the contact form
*	[sublime-jekyll](http://23maverick23.github.io/sublime-jekyll/)

And of course, Jekyll websites can use free hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


There are plenty of websites that use and love Jekyll. Yours should too!
