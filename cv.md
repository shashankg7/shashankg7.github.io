#####<span style = 'color: black'>Research Intern &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Research, India  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Jan '15 - Jun '15]</span>

*Bachelor's Thesis work with the [Advanced Development Group](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/adg/)*
<br/>\-- <u>People Search</u> -- Developed retrieval and ranking techniques for fuzzy matching of misspelled "people" queries in e-mail search.
<br/>\-- <u>Neighborhood De-duplication</u> -- Detecting duplicates among 500,000 unstructured and phonetically variant Indian neighborhood descriptions (without geocodes) was tackled with fuzzy matching, synonym learning and subset grouping.
<br/>\-- Both projects involved prototyping and experimentation with different matching metrics and heuristics. [Skills -- C#, SCOPE]

Mentor &nbsp;|&nbsp; Mehul Parsana 
<br/>\-- <u>POS-tagging search queries</u> with Conditional Random Fields and search logs.
<br/>\-- The model developed resulted in a *6% increase in accuracy* over existing methods.
