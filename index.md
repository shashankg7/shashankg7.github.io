Hello, thanks for visiting.

I am currently a 3rd year PhD student at the [IRLab, UvA](http://irlab.science.uva.nl), supervised by [Prof. Maarten De Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/) and [Prof. Harrie Oosterhuis](https://harrieo.github.io/). I am working on the problem of: Unbiased learning to rank from user interactions.  

My primary areas of interest are : Machine learning, Information retrieval, Online and bandit algorithms, Counterfactual evaluation and learning. 

Previously, I was working as a data scientist with the search team at [Flipkart Internet Pvt. Limited, India](https://tech.flipkart.com/data-science/home), where I worked on various query understanding and product ranking problems. 

Prior to joining Flipkart, I was a MS By Research student at the Search and Information Extraction Lab [SIEL, IIIT-Hyderabad](search.iiit.ac.in) under the joint supervision of [Dr. Manish Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gmanish/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fpeople%2Fgmanish%2F#) Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft R&D, India and [Prof. Vasudeva Varma](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vv/Home.html), Dean R&D, IIIT-Hyderabad. 

To find out more about my work, please visit my [CV](/resume-final.pdf), [Publications](/publications/), or [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UvTcU-IAAAAJ&hl=en).

If you want to talk about collaborations, research, or just chat, feel free to email me at: 27392shashankgupta@gmail.com or at s.gupta2@uva.nl.
