Hi!  

Thanks for visiting.

I'm currently a graduate student at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications. 

Previously, I was a [Research Fellow](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/india/msrirf.aspx) at Microsoft Research, India. I worked on computational models for code-switching with [Monojit Choudhury](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/monojitc/) and [Kalika Bali](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/kalikab/).

For more about my work, please see my [CV](/resume.pdf) and [publications list](/publications/).
